For all of the molecules chosen, it was shown that the energy spectra grow with increasing magnetic field strength (Larmor frequency), vibrational level, and inverse quadratic potential strength g. Look at Tables 3-6. This discovery suggests that the external magnetic field would have a considerable impact on the energy spectrum of the chosen molecules. For all the molecules chosen, the expectation value (s 2), which is always positive, rises with rising rotational energy level o but monotonically falls to zero with rising magnetic field strengths for g = n = 1. View Figure 1 and Table 7. When the magnetic field strength is very high (Larmor frequencies L> 10), the expectation value p2, which is always negative, tends to converge. The expectation value p2 drops with rising rotational energy level o but grows with increasing magnetic field strengths.

When the magnetic field strength is very high (Larmor frequencies L> 10) for all the molecules chosen, the expectation value T, which is always negative, tends to converge for all the molecules for g = n = 1. This is because the expectation value T reduces monotonically with rising rotational energy level o but grows exponentially with increasing magnetic field strengths. View Figure 3 and Table 9. The expectation value 〈𝑉〉 which are all positive increases with increasing rotational energy level 𝑜 as well as the magnetic field strength. A clear divergence is noticeable at all values of magnetic field strength for all the selected molecules for 𝑔 = 𝑛 = 1. See Table 10 and Figure 4. The diamagnetic susceptibility 𝑋 which are all negatives increases monotonically with increasing rotational energy level 𝑜 as well as the magnetic field strength and tend to converge at any 𝜕𝐿> 10 for all the
